# POS System UI/UX Redesign Analysis

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Structure
The current JavaFX POS system has the following key components:

#### Controllers & Screens:
1. **LoadingPage** - Initial splash screen
2. **second_page_controller** - Main role selection dashboard
3. **cashier_login** - Cashier authentication
4. **Cashier_controller** - Main POS interface (needs major redesign)
5. **BranchManager_controller** - Branch management dashboard
6. **DataEntryOperator_controller** - Inventory management
7. **SuperAdminController** - System administration

#### Key Business Logic Preserved:
- Product management (ProductDAO)
- Sales processing (SaleDAO)
- User authentication and roles
- Inventory tracking
- Offline data handling
- Report generation

### Design Problems Identified
